# DATA TYPE

# num_char = str(len(input("whats is your name")))
#
# # or i can use it in another variable
# # new_num_char = str(num_char)
#
# print("Your name has "+ num_char + " characters")

# it is not like the previous one:
# name =input("Whats is ur name\n")
# print(len(name))    -> or print(len(input()))

# a = float(123)
# print(a + "  " + type(a))

# print(70 + float("100.5"))  -> works output is 170.5
# print(str(70)+str(100))     -> works output 70100
# print(70 + float("100.5t")) -> Error because of the letter


# Practice
# Write a program that adds the
# digits in a 2 digit number.
# e.g. if the input was 35, then the
# output should be 3 + 5 = 8
#
# two_digit_number = input()   -> str
# a = int(two_digit_number)
# a1 = int(a/10)
# b = int(a%10)
# print(a1 + b)
#
# a= int(two_digit_number/10)    -> Error data type

# Another Solution:   -> using string []
# two_digit_number = input()
#
# first_digit = int(two_digit_number[0])
# second_digit = int(two_digit_number[1])
#
# # Add the two integers together
# two_digit_number = first_digit + second_digit
#
# print(two_digit_number)

# MATHMATICAL OPERATIONS

# in division, it gives 'float' number
# print(2**6)   -> 2^6 power

# print(3 * 3 + 3 / 3 - 3)
# make the answer ti be 3
# print(3 * (3 + 3) / 3 - 3)

# Practice
# Write a program that calculates the
# Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's
# weight and height.
# BMI = w / (h^2)

# height = input()
# weight = input()
# float_height = float(height)
# float_weight = float(weight)
# print(int(float_weight / (float_height**2)))

# Another Solution
# height = input()
# weight = input()
# # Your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# weight_as_int = int(weight)
# height_as_float = float(height)
# # Using the exponent operator **
# bmi = weight_as_int / height_as_float ** 2
# # or using multiplication and PEMDAS
# bmi = weight_as_int / (height_as_float * height_as_float)

# print(8 / 3)            -> 2.66666665
# print(int(8 / 3))       -> 2
# print(round(8 / 3))     -> 3
# print(round(8 / 3, 2))  -> 2.67
# print(round(2.6666, 2)  -> 2.67

# print(type(8/4))     ->  float (always)
# print(type(8//4))    -> int

# score=2
# print("your score is "+score)   -> Error diff data types, all should be str
# print("your score is " + str(score))  -> works, all str
#
# also use f-String
# print(f"your score is {score}")   -> f"" do all the converting

# Practice
# I was reading this article by Tim Urban - Your Life in Weeks and realised just how little time we actually have.
#
# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many weeks we have left, if we live until 90 years old.
#
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our time left in this format:
#
# You have x weeks left.
#
# age = input()
# weeks = int(age) * 52
# left = 4680 - weeks
# print(f"You have {left} weeks left.")
#
# Another Solution
# age = input()
# # Your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
# years = 90 - int(age)
# weeks = years * 52
#
# print(f"You have {weeks} weeks left.")

# name = input("whatrs ur name? ")
# print(f"hello, {name}")          -> works
#
# name = input("whatrs ur name? ")
# print("hello, " + name)          -> works, same data type str
#
# age = 12
# print(f"ure {age} y/o")         -> works using f-String
#
# age = 12
# print("ure " + age)             -> Error diff data types
